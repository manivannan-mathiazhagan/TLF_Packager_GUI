# 📦 TLF Packager GUI  

**GUI Tool for Packaging Clinical Trial Outputs (Tables, Listings, Figures)**  

The **TLF Packager GUI** is a Python + PyQt5 based tool that scans **RTF, DOCX, and PDF** output files from clinical trials, extracts **TLF titles**, and provides an interactive interface for reviewing, filtering, reordering, and packaging outputs. It generates a **final bookmarked PDF** with an **advanced, clickable Table of Contents (TOC)**, making submission deliverables easier to navigate and review.
